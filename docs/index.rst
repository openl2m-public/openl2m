=======================
Welcome to OpenL2M v3.4
=======================

Welcome to the documentation for the "Open Layer 2 Management" project.

OpenL2M is an open source network device management
application designed to allow users with minimal training to perform a set of basic
configuration changes on those devices, with a focus on port or interface (i.e Layer 2) changes.
It does so by providing a consistent WebUI and REST API
for device management, independent of the underlying vendor.

OpenL2M attempts to address the needs of distributed IT groups managing parts
of a shared distributed layer 2 ("switching") network.

While primarily intended to manage network switches, OpenL2M can support any device that has some
sort of network API (e.g. SNMP, SSH, Netconf, REST, etc.) through an extendable internal driver class.

See a list of features per device class supported :doc:`here.<feature_support>`

For quick testing of OpenL2M, we provide `Docker Compose configuration files. <https://github.com/openl2m/docker-test>`_

OpenL2M is written in Python 3 using the Django framework.
Documentation is written in ReStructured Text format, which is rendered with the Sphinx documentation generator.
