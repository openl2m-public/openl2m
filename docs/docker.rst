We provide `Docker Compose configuration files <https://github.com/openl2m/docker-test>`_
to quickly test OpenL2M without configuring a full production setup.

For more details see the `README.txt in the above repository. <https://github.com/openl2m/docker-test/blob/main/README.txt>_`

The roadmap goals do include establishing production level Docker Compose configuration files.
