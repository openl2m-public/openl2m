We provide a few Docker Compose configuration files.
All of these require a working Docker environment, and rights to build/install new images.

*For the repositories below, see the README.txt file for more details on usage!*

**Testing OpenL2M**

To quickly test OpenL2M without the need to fully install all the requirements,
please see `Docker Compose configuration files for testing. <https://github.com/openl2m/docker-test>`_

**Development**

If you are interested in developing OpenL2M, you can take a look at
`this Docker Compose configuration. <https://github.com/openl2m/docker-dev>`_

**Goals**

The roadmap goals do include establishing production level Docker Compose configuration files.
