Version 2.0.0-dev
--------------
Release Date: 2021-TBD

* Complete rewrite of the internal code. There now is a generic Connector() class
  that implements an interface that is called from the Django views. Technology and/or vendor
  specific implementations inherit from this class to implement their version of that interface.
  Additionally, a new session caching strategy is implemented. This should make it easier to
  implement a device cache, so others can have quick access to device settings, without
  the need to re-read the device.

* if LDAP enabled, add log entry showing DN of ldap authentication used.
* password change option for local accounts

Bug fixes:

* many miscellaneous fixes
* show (missing) vlans on tagged Cisco interfaces

Upgrades:

* upgrade to Django v3.1
* upgrade to most recent versions of python packages used.
* using more 'native' python libraries (e.g. netaddr)
