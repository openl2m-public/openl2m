===========
Version 3.3
===========

.. note::

  v3.3 requires Postgres version 13 or greater! (I.e. Ubuntu 20.04 will no longer work.)
  We now use Django v5.1 !

**Version 3.3 adds support for Arista devices and one Netgear device via SNMP, and can read MPLS VRF info from most drivers,
including from SNMP devices that support the standard MIB.**

Version 3.3.3
-------------

Release Date: 2024-11-27

* add basic Netgear SNMP driver (only 1 device tested. See docs.)
* SNMP profiles can be marked as Read-Only, making devices using it automatically Read-Only.
* add Vrf information to API output of Vlan and Interface objects.


Bug fixes:

* fix SSH paging disable for Command-Only devices (regression from 3.3)
* remove vlan edit tab is device is read-only.
* fix support for SNMP authencation with SHA-512.


Version 3.3.2
-------------

Release Date: 2024-11-01

* add interface transceiver information (eg. 10g-LR) where supported.
  Currently available in the HPE Comware SNMP driver, for devices that support it.
* add support for SNMP v3 SHA224 - SHA512 authencation, and AES192 - AES256 privacy.
* add support for Python 3.12 (now supports running under Pythoin v3.10 - v3.12)
* add vrf info to vlan table, for most drivers that support reading router VRF info.

Bug fixes:

* set untagged vlan on tagged ports with AOS-CX API driver.
* fix close bug for some previous device sessions when going to menu or search.


Version 3.3.1
-------------

Release Date: 2024-09-25

* update the Django framework to v5.1
* support Aruba AOS-CX devices for SSH commands (from Netmiko v4.4 library)
* read the SNMP ipAddressIfIndex MIB entries to find interface (ipv4) addresses.
* read the SNMP ipNetToPhysical MIB entries to find (ipv4) ARP data.
* add descriptions to power supplies where available.
* add Top-N page to show recent active devices and users (in menu)
* add documentation showing icons used.
* improvements to the developer documentation.
* simplify SSH (Netmiko) implementation (into driver base code)

Bug fixes:

* remove duplicate 'ifname' url convertor (deprecated in Django 6)


Version 3.3
-----------

Release Date: 2024-09-10

* add reading of 'MPLS VRF' info on devices that may support it (ie. routers).
  VRF details are shown on Device Info tab. Interfaces that are VRF members have a new icon.
  This reads the standars mib 'MPLS-L3VPN-STD'.
* add Arista Networks support to SNMP driver (including VRF info)
* show max possible speed on down interface.
* show IP address(es) on routed interface in icon "hover-over".
* add Switch profile validation (admin interface).
* improved/optimized snmp mib parsing (performance & code readability).
* improve configuration.py documentation.
* for admins, log entries have links to device admin page.
* for Junos PyEZ device, detect "ELS" feature and warn if not found.
* show top-N activity from menu.
* several drivers have simplified logging.
* updates to the developer documentation.

Bug fixes:

* properly log snmp probing errors.
* improve snmp mib parsing.
* improve snmp session error handling.
* improved handling of device hardware details.
* fix crash and allow ":" in interface names.
* more details in SNMP errors.
* simplify logging in the driver classes.
