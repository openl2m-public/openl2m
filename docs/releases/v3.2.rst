Version 3.2
===========

**Version 3.2 adds a Dark Theme, and uses the Bootstrap 5.3 Web UI framework.
It also add a bacis Admin REST API.**

The use of Bootstrap 5.3 significantly improves web accessibility
and updates pages with the new Boostrap 5 look!

A Dark Theme can be chosen from the user menu while on the Home page.

The REST API adds administrative calls to create and edit users, switches,
switch groups, and snmp and credential profiles.
