Version 3.2
===========

**Version 3.2 adds a Dark Theme, and uses the Bootstrap 5.3 Web UI framework.**

The use of Bootstrap 5.3 changes all pages to be significantly more "Web Accessible",
and updates them with the new Boostrap 5 look!

Dark Theme can be chosen from the user menu while on the Home page.
